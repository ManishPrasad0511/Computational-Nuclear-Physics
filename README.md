# Computational-Nuclear-Physics
This repository contains all the python codes I have written for my undergraduate course of Computational Nuclear Physics. \
The numbers at the start of all the python or jupyter notebook codes correspond to the different chapters in the "notes.pdf"\
There are three pdfs that contain the theory for the codes. 
  1. Notes.pdf: Contains theory for almost all of the codes.
  2. Hot and rotating nuclei.pdf: Contains the theory for some of the code in "10. Quantum Hadrodynamics.ipynb"
  3. Time Dependent Schrödinger Equation Notes.pdf Only contains the theory for the "Time Dependent Schrödinger Equation.py"<br />

"PHN-624 ETE Manish Prasad 18122012" is my code for my end term examination for this course.\
nuclear_data.csv contains the data for "11.1 The Semi-Empirical mass formula.ipynb"
