# Computational-Nuclear-Physics
This repository contains all the python codes I have written for my undergraduate course "PHN-624 Computational Nuclear Physics" during my final semester at The Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee (IITR). \
The numbers at the start of all the codes correspond to the different chapters in the "Notes.pdf"\
There are three pdfs that contain the theory for the codes: 
  1. Notes.pdf: Contains theory for almost all of the codes.
  2. Hot and rotating nuclei.pdf: Contains some of the theory for the code in "10. Quantum Hadrodynamics.ipynb"
  3. Time Dependent Schrödinger Equation Notes.pdf Contains the theory for the "Time Dependent Schrödinger Equation.py"

"PHN-624 ETE Manish Prasad 18122012" is my code for my end term examination for this course.\
nuclear_data.csv contains the data for "11.1 The Semi-Empirical mass formula.ipynb"
